## Module Overview

The application is designed with a robust modular architecture where each module handles a specific responsibility. The following diagram summarizes all key modules and their roles:

<img src="./frontend/public/assets/images/module_diagram.png" alt="Module Diagram" width="700"/>

- **Authentication Module**: Handles user signup, login, JWT token-based access for secure entry.
- **API Module**: Acts as the backend entry point for routing requests between frontend and backend services.
- **Database Module**: Stores user data, research paper metadata, embeddings, chunks, and analysis outputs.
- **Paper Processing Module**: Manages file uploads, text extraction from documents, chunking, and vector embeddings.
- **Summarization & Critique Module**: Implements agentic workflow that analyze research papers, generate insights, and produce structured summaries and critiques.

## System Flow

The following flow diagram explains the step-by-step process from paper submission to generation of summaries, critiques, and feedback integration:

<img src="./frontend/public/assets/images/flow_diagram.png" alt="System Flow Diagram" width="420"/>

- Users can upload a PDF of research paper.
- The system fetches and preprocesses the content using specialized parsers.
- The content is chunked, metadata is extracted, and vector embeddings are created.
- LLM Rag chain is invoked that analyze different aspects of the paper.
- Outputs are synthesized and converted into structured reports and bullet lists.
- Summaries generated by user are sotred in database and user can access the generated summaries for reference from a dashboard provided in UI.

---

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**
- **Python**
- **Pinecone VectorDB (for embeddings and retrieval)**
- **MongoDB (for user data and metadata storage)**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**

---

## Features

- **Upload & Extract Papers**: Accepts PDF, extracts text, images, and metadata automatically.
- **Chunking & Embeddings**: Divides text into logical sections and creates vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- **Automated Summarization**: Uses LLM RAG to generate context-aware, structured summaries and critiques.
- **Query Submission**: Users can ask questions about the paper and get AI-powered answers based on vector retrieval.
- **Secure Authentication**: Supports JWT (JSON Web Token)user authentication, session management, and access control.

# Full Stack Application Setup Guide

This project consists of a **React frontend** and a **FastAPI backend**.  
Follow the steps below to set up, install dependencies, and run both parts of the application.

---

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Navigate to the backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

### Installation and Development

Since backend is setup using uv simply run below command, it will install dependencies and run on uvicorn server automatically.

```bash
uv run uvicorn server.main:app --reload --host localhost --port 8000
```

Your server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend (React)

### Navigate to the frontend directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Installation

Install the frontend dependencies:

For the React frontend

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
